	Angular2 VS Angular1, what remains? How to port from 1 to 2?
</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		<em>Angular2</em> is really different from <em>Angular1</em>, no more:
		<ul>
			<li>scope</li>
			<li>digest cycle</li>
			<li>2 way data binding</li>
			<li>controllers</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Some concepts remain, even if their implementation is fully different
		<ul>
			<li>Template expressions, <em>&#123;&#123;expression&#125;&#125;</em>, one way data binding</li>
			<li>2 way data binding can be simulated with help of events</li>
			<li>services</li>
			<li>The notions of <em>directive</em>, even if its name and usage change</li>
			<li>Automatic change detection is still available, but is managed differently by the framework (events)</li>
			<li><em>filters</em> are now named <em>pipes</em></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		To port from <em>Angular1</em> to <em>Angular2</em>, nothing magic, 3 important things:
		<ol>
			<li>Prepare the existing application! Which means follow best practices, make it use recent technologies such as <em>typescript/ES6</em>, and use the <em>angular2</em> router ported to <em>angular1</em></li>
			<li>Use angular1 directives, which will ease the process of converting <em>angular1</em> directives to <em>angular2</em> components</li>
			<li>Include <em>Angular2</em> in your <em>Angular1</em> application, to make them coesxist together and convert things incrementally</li>
