	Angular2 VS Polymer VS React - What's the point
</h2>

<h3>
	<em>Angular2</em> VS <em>Polymer Js</em>
</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		<em><a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/" target="_blank">Polymer</a></em> 
		is not really a framework, unlike <em>Angular2</em>
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>Polymer</em> gives you a <a href="https://elements.polymer-project.org/" target="_blank">set of components</a> 
		and allows anybody to import them in its own application
	</li>
	<li>So <em>Polymer</em> is not really done to do SPAs, with stuff like routing and lifecycles features...</li>
	<li>
		It's more a library to make <em>Web Components</em> and can be used for example
		with <em><a href="https://www.meteor.com/" target="blank">Meteor Js</a></em> in order to add framework features
	</li>
	<li>
		Finally, <em>Polymer</em> components can be used inside <em>Angular2</em> applications as well...
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>
	<em>Angular2</em> vs <em>React</em>
</h3>


<ul>
	<li>
		Common points
		<ul>
			<li>
				Both are frameworks which allow to define view applications
			</li>
			<li>
				Both provide ways to choose the view rendering: browser/ desktop / mobile
			</li>
			<li class="todo">Checker les vuews desktop pour angular2</li>
			<li>
				Both are based on Web Components
			</li>
			<li>
				Both allow you to work with paradigms/patterns such as 
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming" target="_blank">FRP (Functional Reactive Programming)</a>, 
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" target="_blank">OOP (Object Oriented Programming)</a> &amp;

			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Main differences
		<ul>
			<li>
				A <em>React</em> application is a set of libraries provided
				by the community that the developer has to choose and assemble
				in order to get all functionalities he needs: More flexible but more
				work and less stable (be sure that your libraries will be maintain, readapt
				best practices for a new project...)
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>Angular2</em> core library contains everything needed to make a complete application
				work
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>Angular2</em> provides an <em>Inversion Of Control</em> pattern (or Dependency Injection)
				associated with specific components such as <em>Pipes</em>, <em>Services</em> (...) for a great
				separation of concerns
			<li>
			<li>
				The mechanisms to detect changes are different, the one of <em>Angular2</em> can be redefined
				<ul>
					<li>
						<em>React</em>: Automatic Virtual DOM differences detection plus custom implementations
						to disable rendering of some components. The Virtual Dom is an "in memory" version of the
						DOM, once it's state change, an algorithm compares it with the real DOM and find the faster
						way to update the real DOM (so with a minimal number of operation)
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>Angular</em>: On each browser event (js turn), the detection change algorithm is 
						called to check each component changes (<a href="">details here</a>) and can be strongly
						faster with good practices such as work with <a href="http://victorsavkin.com/post/133936129316/angular-immutability-and-encapsulation" target="_blank"> immutable objects</a>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>React</em> is a little easier to learn
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
