	Start From Scratch - transpilation
</h2>

<p>
    In order to run your app correctly, your browser needs an <em>ES5</em> version of your app.
    So, what are your choices if you use
    <em>typescript</em> or <em>ES6</em>. 
</p>

<ul>
    <li>If you use <em>typescript</em>, you can decide to transpile
    your code directly into <em>ES5</em> which is perfectly fine. You
    can do that by different ways:
        <ul>
            <li>
                With <em>tsc</em>: the official <em>typescript</em> compiler,
                which is the usual way to compile typescript
            </li>
            <li>
                With <em>typescript.js</em> which will do the transpilation at
                runtime. This is really interesting to, and mainly to POC something directly
                on the web (this way, you don't need any tool, everything is
                done by the browser). It's bad for performance purpose and won't
                let you check for compilations errors before runtime...
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        If you use <em>ES6</em>, you still need to transpile it to <em>ES5</em>.
        Again, you have the possibility to transpile it at runtime (then slower at runtime)
        or before. Two solutions:
        <ul>
           <li class="todo">Vérifier en détail pourquoi babel est meilleur que traceur</li> 
           <li> <a href="https://github.com/babel/babel" target="_blank"><em>Babel</em></a> : The most used and most complete actually </li>
           <li> <a href="https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler" target="_blank"><em>Google Traceur</em></a>: Which works also fine </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        If you use <em>typescript</em> and transpile to <em>ES6</em>, then:
        <ul>
            <li>Be sure to have a good reason to do that</li>
            <li>Refer to the previous point to transpile from <em>ES6</em> to <em>ES5</em></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
