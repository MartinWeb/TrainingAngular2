	ES6 Introduction - Arrow Functions
</h2>

<p>
	Arrow functions are yet another feature which appeared on many languages
	such as scala, more recently java, and probably many more.
	But often, in those languages, it was interesting in order to create
	kind of anonymous functions, and which can be used as parameters of other
	ones, which is not necessary in <em>Javascript</em> since functions can
	be anonymous and declared as variables...
	So what does arrow functions offer interesting in JavaScript?
</p>
<ul>
	<li>A lighter syntax</li>
	<li>
		There is not a specific <em>this</em> attached to them,
		which can be inrteresting when working in classes for example
		(no more mix between the <em>this</em> of the class instance and the
		one of the current function)
	</li>
</ul>

//
class Person{
	constructor(firstName, lastName, age, friends){
		this.firstName= firstName;
		this.lastName= lastName;
		this.age= age;
		this.friends= friends;
		this.computeMaxAgeFromFriends();
	}

	// Only one instruction, no block,
	// then the return keyword is implicit
	getfirstName= () => this.firstName;

	// I can use a block as well
	getLastName= () => {
		return this.lastName;
	}

	//No specific this is bound to arrow functions,
	// so this always refer to the class instance, which
	// would not be the case with classic functions
	let computeMaxAgeFromFriends= () => {
		this.maxAge= 0;
		this.friends.forEach( (friend) => {
			if (friend.age > this.maxAge){
				this.maxAge= friend.age;
			}
		} );
