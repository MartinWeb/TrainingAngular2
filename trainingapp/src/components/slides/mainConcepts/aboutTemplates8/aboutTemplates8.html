<p>
    <em>Expressions</em> are almost like js, but are not:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The context is the bean ( access to the bean properties, 
        not global js variables )
    </li>
    <li>
        The <em>new</em> operator is prohibited
    </li>
    <li>
        As wel as increment / decrement operators
    </li>
    <li>
        Bitwise operators ( | and &amp; ) are not supported
    </li>
    <li>
        Use filters in expressions with |
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    As in <em>Angular1</em>, remember that expressions are in the view,
    and that the view shouldn't contains complex code. Then keep expressions
    simple and prefer add a method on your <em>bean</em>.
</p>

<pre>
    //NO
    [isEligible]="(user.age > 13 &amp;&amp; user.friends.length > 3 &amp;&amp; isInList(user.preferedMovie)"

    //OK
    [isEligible]="checkEligible()"
</pre>

<p>
    If your HTML parser doesn't like brackets, use the canonical syntax:
</p>

<pre>
    bind-property-name="your expression"
</pre>
