	Router - And More
</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		We have seen the essentials <em>Router</em>
		features
	</li>
	<li>
		But as we have seen, <em>Router</em> is a complete
		library to answer most of routing problematics you can
		encounter
	</li>
	<li>
		If you need to disable the routing of a component conditionally,
		or not authorize to acceed to a component view based on some conditions,
		use the following hooks: 
		<ul>
			<li>
				<em>CanActivate</em>: implement the <em>CanActivate</em> interface
				by adding the <em>routerCanActiate</em> method, and return either
				a boolean or a <em>Promise</em> to authorize the component to be
				activated or not.
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>CanDeactivate</em>: <em>CanActivate</em> allows
				to authorize or not to access to a component view, whereas
				<em>CanDeactivate</em> authorize or not to leave a component
				view
			</li>
			<li class="todo">
				<em>OnActivate</em>: Ne vois pas la différence avec <em>CanACtivate</em>, semble se produire aprés et être utile
				pour redirection
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Finally, you can also define a route by using a loader, which can be usefull to resolve
		a component dynamically: this mechanism is used for this slides application. Each slide
		is a component which is resolved dynamically by using conventions between the route name
		and the component name.
