	Custom Components - What do we know
</h2>

<p>
	To summarize what we have already seen about components
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<em>Components</em> are <em>directives</em> with templates:
		<ul>
			<li>Use of <em>template</em> and <em>templateUrl</em> attributes</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>Components</em> and <em>Directives</em> allow to add some behavior to your app
	</li>
	<li>
		Custom <em>components</em>/<em>directives</em> are referenced
		in templates through their name, 
		and you also have to declare them in order to use them
		<ul>
			<li>
				The <em>selector</em> attribute allows 
				to give them a name
			</li>
			<li>
				The <em>directives</em> attributes allow
				to declare the custom <em>Components</em> 
				on which you depend
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>
		You can also get references of your directive instance
		in the whole template with the <em>exportAs</em> attribute
	</li>

	<li>
		Our <em>Components</em>/<em>Directives</em>
		are parameterizables through the <em>Property Binding</em>
		mechanism, which is a <em>top to down</em> communication
		<ul>
			<li>
				The properties bindings can be
				declared through the <em>inputs</em> attribute
			</li>
			<li>
				Or with the <em>@Input()</em> annotation
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>
		With the help of events, you can communicate from a child component
		to a parent one, which is a <em>down to top</em> communication
		<ul>
			<li>
				the event to throw can be declare with the <em>outpus</em> attribute
			</li>
			<li>
				Or with the <em>@Output()</em> annotation
			</li>
		</ul>		
	</li>

	<li>
		Our <em>Components</em>/<em>Directives</em> could depend
		on services, and we could want specific providers for them
		<ul>
			<li>It's what the <em>providers</em> attribute is for</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

</ul>
