	Dependency Injection - Introduction
</h2>

<p>
    We have seen the basic types of elements available
    in <em>Angular2</em>, and missed one of the important
    feature provided, the Dependency Injection.
</p>

<p>
   Basically, Dependecy Injection (DI), also called Inversion Of Control (IOC)
    is not specific to <em>Angular2</em>, it's a common pattern used by many 
    frameworks and whose the goal is to minimize the modifications of code 
    when an implementation changes and to let the framework manage instantiations
    for you. 
</p>



<p>
    Whatever A and B are, if I want to inject A in B
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Without DI:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Create A: <code>var a= new A(); </code>
            </li>
            <li>
                Attach A to B: <code> b.setA(a); </code>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        With DI:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Tell the framework that B depends on A, 
                and let the framework <em>control</em> 
                this dependency:
                <pre>
// configuration feature somewhere
// ! THIS IS NOT ANGULAR 
config.declareDeps(A, [B]);
                </pre>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
