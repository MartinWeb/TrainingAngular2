	Dependency Injection - DI Exceptions

<p>
    But <em>typescript</em> doesn't create these metadata for every class.
    Yes, why would it do that? <em>typescript</em> is not related only
    to <em>Angular2</em>, and even in this case, every class doesn't
    necessarily need a <em>DI</em> mechanism.
</p>

<p>
    In fact, <em>typescript</em> will generate these <em>metadata</em> when
    <em>Annotations</em> are associated to a class or its constructor.
    Which means that they will be added for components (<code>@Component</code>),
    pipes (<code>@Pipe</code>), but not for services which, by default are not
    annotated.
</p>

 <p>
     To force <em>metadata</em> to be generated also for <em>services</em>,
     you can add an annotation on this service, 2 solutions: 
 </p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Add <code>@Inject</code> on the cpnstructor parameters:
        <pre>constructor(@Inject(MyService) myService: MyService){}</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>@Injectable</code> on the service class:
        <pre>
            @Injectable
            class MyService{
                constructor(dep: MyDepService){ 
                    //...
                }
            }
        </pre> 
    </li>
</ul>
