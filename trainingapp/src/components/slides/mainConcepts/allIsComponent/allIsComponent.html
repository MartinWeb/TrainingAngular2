<p class="todo">
    Remplacer Components par classes
</p>

<p>
    <em>Angular2</em> can be considered easier than <em>Angular1</em> for several
    reasons, and particularly because: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Complex concepts have disappeared: 
        <em>controllers</em> and their <em>scope</em> plus <em>digest cycle</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        All concepts are now build upon components:
        <ul>
            <li>
                services, directives, pipes
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
