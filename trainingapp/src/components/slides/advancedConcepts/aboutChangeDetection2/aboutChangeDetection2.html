	Change Detection - Intro - When and Where - When
</h2>

<p>
	There are 2 questions here
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		When to check for changes?
	</li>
	<li>
		Where to update the changes?
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>
		To know when, we have to wonder which kind of process
		can imply an update.
	</li>
	<li>
		In the previous example, it's when the <em>$http</em>
		service answers
	</li>
	<li>
		If a user update fields from a form and validate it,
		its when the <em>change</em> and <em>cllick</em> events
		are submit
	</li>
	<li>
		Common point between previous examples? A callback is called, which means each time an asynchronous event is
		sent
	</li>
	<li>
		And there are a lot of <em>HTML5 Apis</em>
		which are based on callback, almost all in fact...
	</li>
</ul>
