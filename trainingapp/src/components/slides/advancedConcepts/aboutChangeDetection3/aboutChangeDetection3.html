	Change Detection - Intro - When and Where - When
</h2>

<p>
	So the question becomes, how is <em>Angular2</em>
	aware that a callback has been called?
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		The <em>Anguar</em> team builds the 
		<em><a href="">Zone</a></em> API 
	</li>
	<li>
		Its role is precisely to intercept events
		and so <em>Angular2</em> uses it to run 
		its detection change feature, the idea is (not the true code):
		<editortab [alone]="true" title="sample-zone.js" fileType="js" >
this.zone.onTurnDone
      .subscribe(() => this.zone.run(() => changeDetection());
		</editortab>
	</li>
</ul>
