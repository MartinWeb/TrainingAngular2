	ES6 Introduction - Arrow Functions
</h2>

<p>
	Arrow functions ( => ) are yet another feature which appeared on many languages
	such as scala, more recently java, and probably many more.
	But what does it add to <em>Javascript</em>, since anonymous functions 
	can already be used for callbacks?
</p>
<ul>
	<li>A lighter syntax</li>
	<li>
		There is not a specific <em>this</em> attached to them,
		which can be inrteresting when working in classes for example
		(no more mix between the <em>this</em> of the class instance and the
		one of the current function)
	</li>
</ul>

class Person{
	constructor(firstName, lastName, age, friends){
		this.firstName= firstName;
		this.lastName= lastName;
		this.age= age;
		this.friends= friends;
		this.computeMaxAgeFromFriends();
	}

	// Only one instruction, no block,
	// then the return keyword is implicit
	getfirstName= () => this.firstName;

	// I can use a block as well
	getLastName= () => {
		return this.lastName;

	//No specific this is bound to arrow functions,
	// so this always refer to the class instance, which
	// would not be the case with classic functions

		this.maxAge= 0;
		this.friends.forEach( (friend) => {
