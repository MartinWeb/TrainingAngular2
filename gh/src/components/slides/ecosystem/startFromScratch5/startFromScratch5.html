    A good way to test something with <em>Angular2</em>
    is to use the <em>typescript.js</em> transpiler at
    runtime, because you don't need to install anything to use
    it. But again, if this is perfect for POCs, it's 
    not recommended at all for production purposes...

    The following <a href="http://plnkr.co/edit/AkuQxM30cjJLATQ9A2zO?p=info" target="_blank">minimal application sample</a>
     shows you how an example, below are the starting steps of the app:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The index page is loaded</li>
    <li>Some polyfills are loaded</li>
    <li>Angular core itself is loaded</li>
    <li>The <em>SystemJs</em> module loader is configured</li>
    <li>At this point, everything needed to run an application is there</li>
    <li>The application is loaded: <pre>System.import('app/boot')</pre></li>
</ol>
