	ES6 Introduction - Templates literals
</h2>

<p>
	If you come from the <em>java</em> world (and in fact, from most of
	other languages), you are probably used to format <em>Strings</em>
	with specific methods. In javascript, most of time, this was done by
	just concatenating the strings you need.
	From <em>ES6</em>, you will have a new machanism for that (which hunappily
	remains less powerfull than it could)
