	Classes Are Everywhere - Directives / Components
</h2>


<p>
    <em>Directives</em> concept in <em>Angular2</em> is very similar to the 
    <em>Angular1</em> one, two possibilities:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A graphical component, so a <em>Web Component</em>: With the <em>@Component</em> annotation
    </li>
    <li>
        A new behavior on an existing element: 
        <em>@Directive</em> , this is not a graphical component 
        (for example the <em>ngForm</em> directive allows to 
        add behavior for forms management)
    </li>
</ul>
