    Practical Work - Services
</h2>

<p>
    Let's play with some services, essentially <em>http</em>, 
    to implement our own  <em>NewsService</em> service.
</p>




<ul class="exercise">
    <li>
        To run your server only: <code>npm run serve</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        To compile your ts only: <code>npm run compile</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        To do both: <code>npm run dev</code>
        (as long as you don't create new ts files, each modification will be compiled automatically, if you need
        to create a new <em>typescript</em> file run the <em>compile</em> target manually)
    </li>
    <li>
        Access  your application <a href="http://localhost:3000/" target="_blank">here</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Have a look at the <em>app</em> folder structure to have an idea of where are the
        things you'll have to implement. Ask if you have any question!
    </li>
</ul>


<ul>
    <li>
        Have a look at <em>NewsService</em>:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Test your dev directly on the main page
            </li>
            <li>
                Complete the <em>getNews</em> method by using the <em>http</em>
                service: method is GET &amp; url is '/api/news'.
                Be sure to keep an instance of news instead of call <em>http</em>
                everytime
            </li>
            <li>
                Complete the <em>addLike</em> method: method POST &amp; url is '/api/news/like/(news id)'.
                The post doesn't need specific data.
                Remember to update the number of likes on the local news when <em>http</em> answers successfully
            </li>
            <li>
                Complete <em>addNews</em>:
                method POST &amp; url is /api/news &amp; POST content is the news itself.
                Update your local news on success.
            </li>
            <li>
                Complete <em>deleteNews</em>:
                method DELETE &amp; url is /api/news/' followed by the news id.
                Update your local news.
            </li>
            <li>
                Complete <em>randomNews</em>:
                method GET &amp; url is '/api/news/random' 
            </li>            
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
