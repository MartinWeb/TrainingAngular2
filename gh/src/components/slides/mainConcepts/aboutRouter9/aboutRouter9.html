	Router - And More
</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		We have seen the essentials <em>Router</em>
		features
	</li>
	<li>
		But as we have seen, <em>Router</em> is a complete
		library to answer most of routing problematics you can
		encounter
	</li>
	<li>
		If you need to disable the routing of a component conditionally,
		or not authorize to acceed to a component view based on some conditions,
		use the following hooks: 
		<ul>
			<li>
				<em>CanActivate</em>: implement the <em>CanActivate</em> interface
				by adding the <em>routerCanActiate</em> method, and return either
				a boolean or a <em>Promise</em> to authorize the component to be
				activated or not.
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>CanDeactivate</em>: <em>CanActivate</em> allows
				to authorize or not to access to a component view, whereas
				<em>CanDeactivate</em> authorize or not to leave a component
				view
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>OnActivate</em>: the <em>routerOnActivate</em> method is called when
				the routing is successuffly done, if the function returns a Promise, 
				the router will wait it is solved bedore instanciating child components
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>OnDeactivate</em>: the <em>routeOnDeactivate</em> is called before the
				leaved component is destroyed, if the function returns a Promise, the
				router will wait it is solved before destroying the view
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
