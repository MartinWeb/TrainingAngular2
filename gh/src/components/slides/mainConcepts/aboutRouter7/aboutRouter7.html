	Router - Child Routers
</h2>


<p>
	We are almost done with the <em>Router</em> api:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		We can create a routing Component to define our routes
	</li>
	<li>
		Navigate to these routes both dynamically and declaratively
	</li>
	<li>
		Check that we succeeded going to this view
	</li>
	<li>
		And pass parameters when switching of view
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	We miss one important concept, the <em>Child Component Routing</em>
	which allows to manage a navigation feature in any child component
	of your application, say independently of your parent component routing.
	Don't forget that your components are such kind of <em>Web Components</em>
	and that they should ideally be reusable somewhere else
