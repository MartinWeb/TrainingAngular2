	Dependency Injection - Introduction
</h2>

<p>
    We have seen the basic types of elements available
    in <em>Angular2</em>, and missed one of the important
    feature provided, the Dependency Injection.
</p>

<p>
   Basically, Dependecy Injection (DI), also called Inversion Of Control (IOC)
    is not specific to <em>Angular2</em>, it's a common pattern used by many 
    frameworks and whose the goal is to minimize the modifications of code 
    when an implementation changes and to let the framework manage instantiations
    for you.
